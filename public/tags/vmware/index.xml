        <description>&lt;img src="https://patrick-koehler.com/p/how-the-vexpert-program-helped-me-to-become-a-better-cloud-architect./title.png" alt="Featured image of post How the vExpert program helped me to become a better Cloud architect." /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody it&amp;rsquo;s Patrick again from the new blog site (yes I finally made it to GitHub with a static page build with Hugo),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this time I want to share my story around why I believe the vExpert program has helped me become a better architect.
As some of you know, I started my IT career already a while back in 2009 where I completed an apprenticeship at IT-Haus (a local German consulting firm and reseller). I started to dig deeper into emerging technologies, got my first steps in vCenter done, learned how cool vMotion is and what it means to host and manage larger IT estates. Moving forward in my career I brought cloud technologies like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services etc. to the mix and I transitioned slightly from the on-premises three tier architecture towards more cloud consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from who did I learn all these things, and what are my resources? Is something I got asked frequently. And to tell you the trough, besides reading books and searching the internet for the solutions I needed, most of the time I landed on pages from vExperts, MVP&amp;rsquo;s etc. Those guys I considered as my rockstars (and they obviously are) in the industry. The knowledge they shared, the passion for technology combined with the willing to help the community inspired me a lot, which is the reason why I started my first blog page back in 2020 with wvdlogix.net. The blog should help me get into EUC and to share my thoughts around Azure Virtual Desktop, VMware Horizon and later on the combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one year of blogging I thought that I should give it a try to apply for the vExpert program, as I want to contribute even more to the awesome community and to learn how to ask the right questions and to help the product team to even improve the technology that we love and that we kind of grew up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it happened! I got accepted for the first time to become a VMware vExpert myself in 2021.
Which by the way should later be the year when I join the incredible company VMware is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-what-did-the-vexpert-program-supported-you-with&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#but-what-did-the-vexpert-program-supported-you-with&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    But what did the vExpert program supported you with?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, it&amp;rsquo;s important to mention that the vExpert program is meant to share knowledge and to collaborate with other tech enthusiasts. That was the first support and one of the most important things I always mention when somebody asks me about the program.
I got access to the group of people via Slack where I was able to ask questions, share my thoughts and get comments and ideas on other peoples experience which helped me also a lot in improving the content that I&amp;rsquo;m sharing with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a great place and actually one of the greatest assets of the program to get access to these fantastic people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it was the licenses for your lab infrastructure. These helped me a lot to improve my architecture and automation skills while implementing the technology in my homelab, tinkering around with the VCF stack, destroying it, rebuilding and starting to become more solid in my conversations with customers which indeed helped to become a better architect. And this again helped me to become a better community member who wants to share expert knowledge and experiences with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides all of that there is a fantastic community lead named Corey Romero, who build the program and has several opportunities and events for you to learn from the product groups and get into deep technical details!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-what-do-i-need-to-do-to-become-a-vexpert&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#but-what-do-i-need-to-do-to-become-a-vexpert&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    But what do I need to do to become a vExpert?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To become a vExpert yourself it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that this recognition is not only a badge to polish your CV, it&amp;rsquo;s also not just an entitlement, it means dedication and willigness to support. To be part of the community a good thing is to connect with other vExperts or vExperts pro via Twitter / X or LinkedIn and ask them for guidance and support (I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of them will be open to support! Otherwise reach out to me at any time). Next should be that you start to blog! Write about your experiences, start to share knowledge regardless how easy it may seem to you, I&amp;rsquo;m sure somebody else with profit from it! Next could be to sign up for a variety of VMUGs (VMware User Groups or UserCons) or even speak at those events! And if you are new to speaking, ask the vExpert community again to provide you with tips and tricks and help to get you prepared for your first showtime, I&amp;rsquo;m sure everybody is willing to help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get into blogging and speaking, it may be time to apply for the vExpert program at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://vexpert.vmware.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://vexpert.vmware.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have to select if you are an Evangelist, customer, partner, VCDX, Moderator or VMUG Leader and provide as much details as you can to your application! After the registration / application time closes you will be notified if you are eligible to become a vExpert!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-what-happens-if-i-didnt-get-the-vexpert-status&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#but-what-happens-if-i-didnt-get-the-vexpert-status&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    But what happens if I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the vExpert status?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry! Sometimes it takes time and patience. Most importantly is, that you do what you love and share knowledge with the wider community. If you need any assistance please feel free to reach out and I try to be as supportive as I can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
Patrick&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-azure-vmware-solution-is-it-the-fastest-path-to-the-cloud/title.png" alt="Featured image of post Mastering Azure VMware Solution - Is it the fastest path to the cloud?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone it&amp;rsquo;s Patrick again with the first blogpost on my new site!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I want to share with you my experiences with Azure VMware Solution and if it&amp;rsquo;s really the fastest path to the cloud.
In this blog series we&amp;rsquo;re discovering the service from a technical perspective and will have a look at competitive products, like Nutanix Cloud Clusters (in short, NC2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the completion of the aquisition of VMware by Broadcom, many customers, partners and customers are afraid of high license costs and uncertanties when it comes to product development and support in their on-premises environments. While many community folks have written blogs about this fact (some more related to bashing VMware rather than having an objective view on the technology,), this blog series has the intention of&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving you a good overview of what Azure VMware Solution is and who provides the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the service incorporates with other Azure Services and which are the most commonly used in this scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is crucial in planning Azure VMware Solution for your organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lessons learned from the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing a big comparision of features, scalability, security and cost for your decision making process!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like this series, let me know and I will be happy to dive deeper in one or the other topic as demanded. But let&amp;rsquo;s start with part 1 - the technical overview of Azure VMware Solution and its competitor Nutanix NC2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;azure-vmware-solution---technical-overview&#34;&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure VMware Solution is a first party solution of Microsoft that&amp;rsquo;s been around for years already, firstly hosted by CloudSimple, nowadays hosted by Microsoft directly on Bare Metal hardware in Azure datacenters around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It consists of the well known product stack, that VMware by Broadcom is providing customers known as VMware Cloud Foundation, consisting of products like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMware vSphere - Which is VMware&amp;rsquo;s virtualization platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vSAN - VMware&amp;rsquo;s storage solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NSX-T - Provides Network &amp;amp; Security virtualization capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMware HCX - Migration &amp;amp; Network Extension solution provided by VMware, which is optional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand also the Azure footprint of resources which should be utilized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Entra ID - IAM for administrative access for Azure based resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual networks - Termination of VPN / Express Route - depending on the topology spoke for Azure native services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site-2-Site VPN or Express Route - Used to establish connectivity between on-premises and Azure, but also to interconnect Azure VMware Platforms on Azure and interconnect with Azure services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Azure Virtual WAN - A networking service that bring networking, security, and routing functionalities together in a central place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Azure Disk Pools or Azure NetApp Files - If datastore must be extended with high performant storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the stack that Microsoft uses to deploy AVS sounds interesting for customers that are coming from a VMware based background, ensuring that they keep the same user and administrative experience than on-premises, it might be exciting to have a quick comperative look at Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2), which is offering an alternative for Hybrid connectivity as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternative-nutanix-cloud-clusters-nc2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#alternative-nutanix-cloud-clusters-nc2&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    Alternative: Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-azure-vmware-solution-is-it-the-fastest-path-to-the-cloud/image-1.png&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;595px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutanix launched their Cloud Clusters product (available for Microsoft Azure and AWS) last year to allow customers to benefit from  hybrid functionalities and workload mobility features than VMware, with the exception that the service is not a first party service of Microsoft Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Nutanix cloud clusters on Azure, the deployment will consist of Bare Metal hardware (the same as Azure VMware Solution uses), with the Nutanix software stack consisting of AOS (Storage), AHV (Hypervisor), Flow (Network virtualization), Prism Central (Management GUI) and a bunch of other tehcnologies, which will be deployed Azure natively like:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual Machines for Flow Gateways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A NAT Gateway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Virtual Networks (One for Bare Metal Management, the other for managing the cluster from a software perspective)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#first-summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    First summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While NC2 looks like a direct competitor, I have to admit that the solution is not only more complex in terms of planning (please keep in mind that I consider the deployment and preparation of resources to be deployed as a plus of complexity compared to AVS), it also incorporates more Azure native products, which have to be well planned ahead before starting the deployment. An additional point to consider is, that NC2 won&amp;rsquo;t be deployed directly from the Azure Marketplace (even though you have the chance of booking it there). You have to have a my.nutanix.com account, a valid subscription to the service and access the NC2 cloud platform via a dedicated and decentralized portal.&lt;/p&gt;

    How we continue to explore AVS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this article provided you with a very good first touchpoint of both solutions, we will focus again on Azure VMware Solution as our core product. In the next blog article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through the process of deploying an AVS datacenter and the preparation tasks you have to consider from a design perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mastering VMware Horizon Cloud on Azure - Configuring UAG Setup</title>
        <link>https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 16:56:47 +0600</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/title.png" alt="Featured image of post Mastering VMware Horizon Cloud on Azure - Configuring UAG Setup" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to my article series on VMware Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure. In the previous articles, we have learned what is needed to prepare the infrastructure to be able to enroll new virtual desktop via the VMware Universal Console. We went through the initial Azure configuration and had a look on how to prepare the certificate for the UAG setup, which we will complete in this tutorial.
If you missed my previous articles, please find them hereafter:
In this article, I will walk you through the configuration settings to enroll our first cloud based POD on Microsoft Azure.
Table of Contents
Prepare a Service Principal for the VMware Universal Console
Before we can start to configure the Universal Console and create the core infrastructure, we need to ensure that we equip our account with administrative privileges in a secure way. For that reason we require to have a Service Principal in place that provides the console with the necessary rights in our tenant, while ensuring that no passwords are exchanged in clear text.
To do so, please login to the Azure portal via &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://portal.azure.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://portal.azure.com&lt;/a&gt; and select Azure Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;677&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;1626px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following window, we need to select App registrations to be able to create our Service Account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-9.png&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;57&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;137px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, we entered the App registrations view, click on “+ New registration” in the top center of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-8.png&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;900px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can provide our Service Principal a random name that we want to assign, in my case I name the principal based on the naming convention from the previous article. Make sure to change the Redirect URI to “Web” and provide the URL “http://localhost:8000“. Once we provided the information, click on “Register” to complete the creation.
Name: SP-HZNC-AVDLogix
Redirect URI: Web
URI: http://localhost:8000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attention! Once the Service Principal has been create make sure to copy the following information and store them in a safe location, as you will need them for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the application (client) ID and Directory ID (Azure AD tenant ID)&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you noted down the information, we navigate to “Certificates &amp;amp; secrets” on the left hand side to generate the required secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In here we need to click on “+ New client secret” and provide a client secret description, which is “Client Secret Horizon” in my case and we set the duration to “24 months“. You can also choose a lower time, before the secret expires, but you have to keep in mind to regenerate the secret and update the Universal Console to not lose access or control over the resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention! Please make sure to copy the Secret Value once you see it, because it will only appear once like this. In case that you missed to copy it, you need to regenerate the client secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a Custom Role for Service Principal (Least Privileges)
Now we are nearly finished with our Service Principal creation, but need to equip it with the required permissions in order to perform tasks in our environment. While doing this we have two options. First, we can assign Contributor rights to our new Service Principal on our subscription, which provides quite a lot of permissions, which we might don’t want if we want to follow the principal of least permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend creating a custom role, with only the required rights, the Service Principal needs on our subscription. I found an article on the VMware KB, stating the creation of the custom role, which unfortunately doesn’t work for my tenant, for that reason, I’m sharing with you the steps that worked out for me.
To do so, we switch to the Subscription menu in our Azure tenant, while searching for “Subscriptions” or selecting it from the portal menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-2.png&#34;
	width=&#34;454&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;796&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;1911px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we switch to the Access control (IAM) menu on the left hand side, clicking on “+ Add” and selecting “Add custom role” as the following step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-1.png&#34;
	width=&#34;330&#34;
	height=&#34;181&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-1_hu78a05e0419498575a723ea15bd40a85d_33341_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w, https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-1_hu78a05e0419498575a723ea15bd40a85d_33341_1024x0_resize_box_3.png 1024w&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;182&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;437px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to provide the name for our custom role, I called mine “CR-AVDLogix-HorizonCloudAzure“. Select “Start from scratch” as the Baseline permission and continue to the “JSON” tab by clicking “Next” two times or by directly clicking on “JSON“&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;201px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the JSON menu, click the edit button on the right hand side, and navigate to the “Actions”: section, where you have to paste the following code, with the named permissions required.&lt;/p&gt;
