        <description>&lt;img src="https://patrick-koehler.com/p/how-the-vexpert-program-helped-me-to-become-a-better-cloud-architect./title.png" alt="Featured image of post How the vExpert program helped me to become a better Cloud architect." /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody it&amp;rsquo;s Patrick again from the new blog site (yes I finally made it to GitHub with a static page build with Hugo),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this time I want to share my story around why I believe the vExpert program has helped me become a better architect.
As some of you know, I started my IT career already a while back in 2009 where I completed an apprenticeship at IT-Haus (a local German consulting firm and reseller). I started to dig deeper into emerging technologies, got my first steps in vCenter done, learned how cool vMotion is and what it means to host and manage larger IT estates. Moving forward in my career I brought cloud technologies like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services etc. to the mix and I transitioned slightly from the on-premises three tier architecture towards more cloud consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from who did I learn all these things, and what are my resources? Is something I got asked frequently. And to tell you the trough, besides reading books and searching the internet for the solutions I needed, most of the time I landed on pages from vExperts, MVP&amp;rsquo;s etc. Those guys I considered as my rockstars (and they obviously are) in the industry. The knowledge they shared, the passion for technology combined with the willing to help the community inspired me a lot, which is the reason why I started my first blog page back in 2020 with wvdlogix.net. The blog should help me get into EUC and to share my thoughts around Azure Virtual Desktop, VMware Horizon and later on the combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one year of blogging I thought that I should give it a try to apply for the vExpert program, as I want to contribute even more to the awesome community and to learn how to ask the right questions and to help the product team to even improve the technology that we love and that we kind of grew up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it happened! I got accepted for the first time to become a VMware vExpert myself in 2021.
Which by the way should later be the year when I join the incredible company VMware is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-what-did-the-vexpert-program-supported-you-with&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#but-what-did-the-vexpert-program-supported-you-with&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    But what did the vExpert program supported you with?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, it&amp;rsquo;s important to mention that the vExpert program is meant to share knowledge and to collaborate with other tech enthusiasts. That was the first support and one of the most important things I always mention when somebody asks me about the program.
I got access to the group of people via Slack where I was able to ask questions, share my thoughts and get comments and ideas on other peoples experience which helped me also a lot in improving the content that I&amp;rsquo;m sharing with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a great place and actually one of the greatest assets of the program to get access to these fantastic people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it was the licenses for your lab infrastructure. These helped me a lot to improve my architecture and automation skills while implementing the technology in my homelab, tinkering around with the VCF stack, destroying it, rebuilding and starting to become more solid in my conversations with customers which indeed helped to become a better architect. And this again helped me to become a better community member who wants to share expert knowledge and experiences with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides all of that there is a fantastic community lead named Corey Romero, who build the program and has several opportunities and events for you to learn from the product groups and get into deep technical details!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-what-do-i-need-to-do-to-become-a-vexpert&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#but-what-do-i-need-to-do-to-become-a-vexpert&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    But what do I need to do to become a vExpert?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To become a vExpert yourself it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that this recognition is not only a badge to polish your CV, it&amp;rsquo;s also not just an entitlement, it means dedication and willigness to support. To be part of the community a good thing is to connect with other vExperts or vExperts pro via Twitter / X or LinkedIn and ask them for guidance and support (I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of them will be open to support! Otherwise reach out to me at any time). Next should be that you start to blog! Write about your experiences, start to share knowledge regardless how easy it may seem to you, I&amp;rsquo;m sure somebody else with profit from it! Next could be to sign up for a variety of VMUGs (VMware User Groups or UserCons) or even speak at those events! And if you are new to speaking, ask the vExpert community again to provide you with tips and tricks and help to get you prepared for your first showtime, I&amp;rsquo;m sure everybody is willing to help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get into blogging and speaking, it may be time to apply for the vExpert program at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://vexpert.vmware.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://vexpert.vmware.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have to select if you are an Evangelist, customer, partner, VCDX, Moderator or VMUG Leader and provide as much details as you can to your application! After the registration / application time closes you will be notified if you are eligible to become a vExpert!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-what-happens-if-i-didnt-get-the-vexpert-status&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#but-what-happens-if-i-didnt-get-the-vexpert-status&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    But what happens if I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the vExpert status?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry! Sometimes it takes time and patience. Most importantly is, that you do what you love and share knowledge with the wider community. If you need any assistance please feel free to reach out and I try to be as supportive as I can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
Patrick&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mastering VMware Horizon Cloud on Azure - Configuring UAG Setup</title>
        <link>https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 16:56:47 +0600</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/title.png" alt="Featured image of post Mastering VMware Horizon Cloud on Azure - Configuring UAG Setup" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to my article series on VMware Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure. In the previous articles, we have learned what is needed to prepare the infrastructure to be able to enroll new virtual desktop via the VMware Universal Console. We went through the initial Azure configuration and had a look on how to prepare the certificate for the UAG setup, which we will complete in this tutorial.
If you missed my previous articles, please find them hereafter:
In this article, I will walk you through the configuration settings to enroll our first cloud based POD on Microsoft Azure.
Table of Contents
Prepare a Service Principal for the VMware Universal Console
Before we can start to configure the Universal Console and create the core infrastructure, we need to ensure that we equip our account with administrative privileges in a secure way. For that reason we require to have a Service Principal in place that provides the console with the necessary rights in our tenant, while ensuring that no passwords are exchanged in clear text.
To do so, please login to the Azure portal via &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://portal.azure.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://portal.azure.com&lt;/a&gt; and select Azure Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;alt text&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;677&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;1626px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following window, we need to select App registrations to be able to create our Service Account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-9.png&#34;
	width=&#34;123&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;alt text&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;57&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;137px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, we entered the App registrations view, click on “+ New registration” in the top center of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-8.png&#34;
	width=&#34;454&#34;
	height=&#34;121&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-8_hue2d89010c11a5859a71d01d686a3ac97_29245_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w, https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-8_hue2d89010c11a5859a71d01d686a3ac97_29245_1024x0_resize_box_3.png 1024w&#34;
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;alt text&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;375&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;900px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can provide our Service Principal a random name that we want to assign, in my case I name the principal based on the naming convention from the previous article. Make sure to change the Redirect URI to “Web” and provide the URL “http://localhost:8000“. Once we provided the information, click on “Register” to complete the creation.
Name: SP-HZNC-AVDLogix
Redirect URI: Web
URI: http://localhost:8000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-7.png&#34;
	width=&#34;454&#34;
	height=&#34;243&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-7_hua129965d92b1d9e8c8a0d09551321cf3_31072_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w, https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-7_hua129965d92b1d9e8c8a0d09551321cf3_31072_1024x0_resize_box_3.png 1024w&#34;
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;alt text&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;186&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;448px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention! Once the Service Principal has been create make sure to copy the following information and store them in a safe location, as you will need them for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the application (client) ID and Directory ID (Azure AD tenant ID)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-6.png&#34;
	width=&#34;454&#34;
	height=&#34;95&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-6_hu1fdc2a68417c8d4466159c75fa6a6f31_17512_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w, https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-6_hu1fdc2a68417c8d4466159c75fa6a6f31_17512_1024x0_resize_box_3.png 1024w&#34;
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;alt text&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;477&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;1146px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you noted down the information, we navigate to “Certificates &amp;amp; secrets” on the left hand side to generate the required secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-5.png&#34;
	width=&#34;141&#34;
	height=&#34;286&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-5_hu83331bc69b9191e9a92e095ae1a95864_17799_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w, https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-5_hu83331bc69b9191e9a92e095ae1a95864_17799_1024x0_resize_box_3.png 1024w&#34;
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;alt text&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;49&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;118px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In here we need to click on “+ New client secret” and provide a client secret description, which is “Client Secret Horizon” in my case and we set the duration to “24 months“. You can also choose a lower time, before the secret expires, but you have to keep in mind to regenerate the secret and update the Universal Console to not lose access or control over the resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-4.png&#34;
	width=&#34;454&#34;
	height=&#34;243&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-4_huf8ce80f1e352db9f7f98e9bce8e92ca9_34355_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w, https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-4_huf8ce80f1e352db9f7f98e9bce8e92ca9_34355_1024x0_resize_box_3.png 1024w&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;186&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;448px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention! Please make sure to copy the Secret Value once you see it, because it will only appear once like this. In case that you missed to copy it, you need to regenerate the client secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-3.png&#34;
	width=&#34;454&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;2095px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a Custom Role for Service Principal (Least Privileges)
Now we are nearly finished with our Service Principal creation, but need to equip it with the required permissions in order to perform tasks in our environment. While doing this we have two options. First, we can assign Contributor rights to our new Service Principal on our subscription, which provides quite a lot of permissions, which we might don’t want if we want to follow the principal of least permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend creating a custom role, with only the required rights, the Service Principal needs on our subscription. I found an article on the VMware KB, stating the creation of the custom role, which unfortunately doesn’t work for my tenant, for that reason, I’m sharing with you the steps that worked out for me.
To do so, we switch to the Subscription menu in our Azure tenant, while searching for “Subscriptions” or selecting it from the portal menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-2.png&#34;
	width=&#34;454&#34;
	height=&#34;57&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-2_hu733fa076949b6108c3c7b2a21c5089a9_11821_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w, https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-2_hu733fa076949b6108c3c7b2a21c5089a9_11821_1024x0_resize_box_3.png 1024w&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;796&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;1911px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we switch to the Access control (IAM) menu on the left hand side, clicking on “+ Add” and selecting “Add custom role” as the following step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-1.png&#34;
	width=&#34;330&#34;
	height=&#34;181&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-1_hu78a05e0419498575a723ea15bd40a85d_33341_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w, https://patrick-koehler.com/p/mastering-vmware-horizon-cloud-on-azure-configuring-uag-setup/image-1_hu78a05e0419498575a723ea15bd40a85d_33341_1024x0_resize_box_3.png 1024w&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;182&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;437px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to provide the name for our custom role, I called mine “CR-AVDLogix-HorizonCloudAzure“. Select “Start from scratch” as the Baseline permission and continue to the “JSON” tab by clicking “Next” two times or by directly clicking on “JSON“&lt;/p&gt;
